YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE EXCECUTABLE DIR IN TWO FILES, see:
-> submit.condor
-> submit2.condor

We want to run python_script.py which ouputs files in the output/ directory (outfile_XA.txt). 
After that job is completed, we want to have python_script2.py, which simply opens the output
files, multiplies the number inside by two, then makes a new file (outfile_XB.txt).  

>> python setup.py (generates the DAGMan in scratch dir)
>> condor_submit_dag scratch/dag.submit (submits to cluster)

Files will appear in the output/ directory. First the PARENT job wil produce outfile_XA.txt,
then once those complete the CHILD jobs run producing the outfile_XB.txt.
